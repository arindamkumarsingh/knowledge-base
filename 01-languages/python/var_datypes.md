# VARIABLES

we can create any name variable like for eg:

```py
message = "hello boii"
print(message)
```

OUTPUT
> hello boi

making variable makes a little work for py interpreter.

we can modify it directly by adding another message in `message` then it will append the content in the variable.

## some rules while naming variable

* only letters, numbers, underscores to be used, don't start variables with number rest all can be used.

* no spaces in variable name.

* Avoid python keywords(**built-in functions**)

* keep it short.

# Strings

```py
"This is a string"
'This is also a string'
```

both are correct, so flexiblity is acceptable for quoting.

> 'I told my friend, "Python is a good lang"'

## Changing case in string with METHODS

```py
name = "arindam kumar singh"

print(name.title())
```

methods like title(), upper(), lower().

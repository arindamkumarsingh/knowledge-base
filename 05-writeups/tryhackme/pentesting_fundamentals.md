# Intro

### What is pentesting?

a pentest is an attempt to test and analyse the security of an organisation to protect its assets and pieces of information.

A pentest is an **authorised audit** which tests a system's security and defenses.

Before pentesting starts, a detailed meeting happens with the client, disscussions happens as to what all will be tested and given approval.

Companies which do pentesting must follow their country's legal guidelines and get approved.

* White hat = Authorised pentesters

* Grey hat = like mr.robot

* Black hat = malware writers etc.

## ROE

Rules of engagement is a document signed before the pentesting which specifies what all to be carried out.

* Permissions = 

* test scope = Scope as of what all devices or servers will be covered in this test.

* **Rules** = like if phishing is prohibhited, but Man-in-the-middle attacks are okay.

# Pentesting methodologies

* Information Gathering = OSINT where main aim is to gather as many publically available info abt the organisation/target(no scanning of systems).

* Enumeration/scanning = this stage involves finding apps and services running in the background.

* Exploitation = exploiting vuln found in the systems with the use of public exploits or app logic.

* Privelge escalation = ONce successfully exploited(foothold), then would like to escalate privelge horizontally(accessing other accounts in the system) or vertically(accessing other permission groups like administrator).

* Post - exploitation = additional environments, covering tracks, reporting.

# Frameworks

various frameworks are followed or ideas to penetration testings.

**OSSTMM**(Open source security Testing Methodology manual) = Methodologies involve (telecommunications, Wired Networks, Wireless Networks).
This framework sets the standard and implemented universal standards.

**OWASP** Specialises in web-apps and

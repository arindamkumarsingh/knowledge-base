# Intro

### What is pentesting?

a pentest is an attempt to test and analyse the security of an organisation to protect its assets and pieces of information.

A pentest is an **authorised audit** which tests a system's security and defenses.

Before pentesting starts, a detailed meeting happens with the client, disscussions happens as to what all will be tested and given approval.

Companies which do pentesting must follow their country's legal guidelines and get approved.

* White hat = Authorised pentesters

* Grey hat = like mr.robot

* Black hat = malware writers etc.

## ROE

Rules of engagement is a document signed before the pentesting which specifies what all to be carried out.

* Permissions = 

* test scope = Scope as of what all devices or servers will be covered in this test.

* **Rules** = like if phishing is prohibhited, but Man-in-the-middle attacks are okay.

# Pentesting methodologies

* Information Gathering = OSINT where main aim is to gather as many publically available info abt the organisation/target(no scanning of systems).

* Enumeration/scanning = this stage involves finding apps and services running in the background.

* Exploitation = exploiting vuln found in the systems with the use of public exploits or app logic.

* Privelge escalation = ONce successfully exploited(foothold), then would like to escalate privelge horizontally(accessing other accounts in the system) or vertically(accessing other permission groups like administrator).

* Post - exploitation = additional environments, covering tracks, reporting.

* Pentest report = After all the above stages are done, then a report must be written explaining all the actions done by you to the client.

# Frameworks

various frameworks are followed or ideas to penetration testings.

**OSSTMM**(Open source security Testing Methodology manual) = Methodologies involve (telecommunications, Wired Networks, Wireless Networks).
This framework sets the standard and implemented universal standards.

**OWASP** Specialises in web-apps and this foundation regularly annually writes report (OWASP Top-10) stating various web-vulnerablities.
Owasp has advantages like its easy to pick up and understand, anhd regularly updates. A drawback can be it doesn't qualify the Checks from the government.

**NIST  CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK** a very popular framework, used by 50% of american companies, this is considered to be a very detailed one and covers all the prospects that a company might need, this is also a disadv because of so much detail, one can find it difficult to apply what factor benefits the other.
Very useful for critical infra(power plant, etc.)

**CAF FRAMEWORK** a 14 principles framework and covers critical infra to all sectors which involves data intensive work.


# Scope

There are mainly three types of scopes, and depends on the amount of knowledge you have abt the system

**Black-box** testing, here u are not having any prior knowledge about the system, u interact like a normal user, testing small features like testing buttons, interacting with it. Here it takes a lot more time in information-gathering and enumeration stages.

**Grey-box** testing, here a limites amt of knowledge is given abt a system, this type of testing fits perfect with the pentesters.

**White-box** testing, here we have total knowledge about the system, the person is basically the programmer which has designed it and now checking all the functionalities.
